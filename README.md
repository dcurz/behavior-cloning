Overview
---
This project was completed as an assignment for Udacity's Self Driving Car Nano Degree [![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive).

The model.py file is used to train a convolutional neural network (h5 file) to provide steering input for a simulated car based on camera input. The training set was generated by driving the car around the simulator myself - see Dependencies below for information on the simulator. Once a baseline model had been established with a large training set - transfer learning was used to refine the model with added training data to refine behavior in specific circumstances where the initial model was failing.  


This project was built using the starter code provided [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3).

Dependencies
---
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

* CarND Term1 Simulator - unfortunately this simulator is only available to students of the course, but see output video for results. 

Contents
---

* model.py
    * trains the Keras-developed network based on the training data (IMG and driving_log) provided to it. Outputs model.h5. 
* model.h5
    * Keras neural network model 
* IMG
    * Place to store training (input) data - ie - image stills from driving around simulator
* driving_log
    * Matches training input data (images in IMG folder) with which camera they were taken from (right, center, or left) as well as a matched steering and throttle position for that image. 
* result_video
    * mp4 file showing car driving autonomously in simulator after training
* drive.py
    * allows simulator to use model to send steering angles autonomously while model is running
